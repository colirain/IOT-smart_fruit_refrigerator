# Overview
To help people live a healthier life and reduce waste of fruits, we propose a smart refrigerator system with corresponding application to keep track of fruits’ expired date and users’ nutrition intake. The main challenge is fruit recognition where we used Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to have trained a model with 97.6% accuracy. And we have accomplished our goal of recognition, alert, recommendation and android application.
